<p>Establishing a platform, probably a website, organizing different categories of graphics into topics and clearly demonstrate the trends/ outliers of datasets collected and analyzed by the data company, AppliedXL. Everyone gets the chance to watch the site, but they will need to subscribe to platform for getting the overall datasets. The platform also collects viewers’ feedbacks on data interpretations.</p>

<p>The dream scenario is getting this platform <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">subscribed</code> by as much newsrooms or freelance journalists as possible or getting as much <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">contribution lines</code> on media outlets (“i.e. Data gathered and analyzed by AppliedXL”) as possible.</p>

<p>For the product’s engineering perspective, the dream scenario is being able to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">automate</code> most of the data piplines and the production of graphics.</p>

<h3 id="at-this-stage-what-do-you-think-the-final-product-or-deliverable-will-be">At this stage, what do you think the final product or deliverable will be?</h3>

<p>Several experiments involving data stories and its advanced data tracker news products. What I have experimented so far:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A. COVID-related clinical trial studies data analysis story as the prototype for the TrialXLl data tracker/ dashboard</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">B. US-listed Chinese companies filling record data analysis story as the prototype for a potential US-listed Chinese companies tracker</code></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C. COVID mask order/ stay at home order/ reopening order data analysis story as the prototype for a potential feature improvement of the CovidXL tracker</code></p>
  </li>
</ul>
