<p>Establishing a platform, probably a website, organizing different categories of graphics into topics and clearly demonstrate the trends/ outliers of datasets collected and analyzed by the data company, AppliedXL. Everyone gets the chance to watch the site, but they will need to subscribe to platform for getting the overall datasets. The platform also collects viewers‚Äô feedbacks on data interpretations.</p>

<p>The dream scenario is getting this platform <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">subscribed</code> by as much newsrooms or freelance journalists as possible or getting as much <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">contribution lines</code> on media outlets (‚Äúi.e. Data gathered and analyzed by AppliedXL‚Äù) as possible.</p>

<p>For the product‚Äôs engineering perspective, the dream scenario is being able to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">automate</code> most of the data piplines and the production of graphics.</p>

<h3 id="some-to---dos">Some TO - DOs:</h3>
