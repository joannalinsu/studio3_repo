### The Dream Scenario of this project:

Establishing a platform, probably a website, organizing different categories of graphics into topics and clearly demonstrate the trends/ outliers of datasets collected and analyzed by the data company, AppliedXL. Everyone gets the chance to watch the site, but they will need to subscribe to platform for getting the overall datasets. The platform also collects viewers' feedbacks on data interpretations. 

The dream scenario is getting this platform ```subscribed``` by as much newsrooms or freelance journalists as possible or getting as much ```contribution lines``` on media outlets ("i.e. Data gathered and analyzed by AppliedXL") as possible. 

For the product's engineering perspective, the dream scenario is being able to ```automate``` most of the data piplines and the production of graphics. 


### Some TO - DOs:

* Data sourcing with computational journalism mindsets.

* Information processing with mathematical, statician focuses. Will get helps from the data scientists on the team. 

* Demonstrating of data findings as graphics.
